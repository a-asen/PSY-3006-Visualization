In this exercise I will attempt to visualize two variables. More specifically attempt to implement a multivariate visualization of two variables. For this exercise, I will use data where two variables, behavioural variability (BV) and approximate entropy (AE), that are used to predict the mental state of mind wandering. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("../data/raw_mwtms_data.csv") -> mw_data 
source("../src/transformation.R") # AE calculation
```


```{r}

```
