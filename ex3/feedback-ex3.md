- QUESTION: 
  The data was prepared outside this repository, because it is not published yet. Should I incldue the scripts/data for the conversion? (I think the data may be left out for others to retrieve later - the osf link is there)
  - If not publishing then I might need to change the .csv file to the "final" file transformation?
