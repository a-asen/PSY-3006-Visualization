Supervisor feedback:
- Use am/pm distinction not 24 hour (seems like there is 12 hours between 5 and 18)
  - Could use a common 18/6 name to indicate that it is 6 or 18.
- Maybe include wake time. 
  - Band between sleep and wake time. 
  
  
Self:
- Could display the clock time as actual clock (lubridate or POSXI)?
