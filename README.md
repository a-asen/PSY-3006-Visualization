# Visualization with ggplot2

This is a repository for a data visualization course at the UiT - The Arctic University of Norway in R. The course is taken as an 'independent study' course ([PSY-3006 - Independent study](https://en.uit.no/education/courses/course?p_document_id=805702&semester=H)) for my Masters in Psychology. The focus of the course is to learn to use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to effectively visualize data. Similarly, data transformations related to visualizing data, as well as commenting on coding progress will be done. 

## Content of the repository

The repository will have 4 exercise folders (e.g., 'ex1') containing relevant material for each visualization. Under each folder, I will follow conventional folder structuring schema (e.g., ProjectTemplate). Each exercise may contain 'src' folder for all R scripts related to creating data and/or relevant data transformations. Data may be created (i.e., fake data) or downloaded from publicly available sources and will be stored in the 'data' folder. Lastly, a 'report' folder will contain a '.qmd' (Quarto) document that contains the relevant data visualization code as well as remarks regarding the plots.


## Content of the course:

In this course, the student will learn how to use R to prepare, transform, and plot data. The course will focus on teaching the student different ways to visualize data sets. The student should learn how to effectively convey messages by choosing appropriate plots and explaining why a certain visualization method is superior to other plots. The student will learn relevant data tidying and transformation needed for the different visualizations. The student should be able to use effective coding strategies -- that are reproducible -- to plot data. The student will have to write a reproducible report using Quarto, which includes the code and the generated output. The course will consist of 4 different exercises that are agreed upon with the supervisor and pertain to various visualization plots. These exercises will be integrated into a final report with reflections and improvements from the student. The student will learn to share their code publicly (e.g., on GitHub). The student will share their coding progress with their supervisors (e.g., on GitHub), where the supervisor can provide feedback and improvements to the code.

## Learning objectives

Having attended the course and completed the exam, the students will obtain the following learning objectives:

### Knowledge and understanding:

-   ... generate and/or find data to be used for plotting.
-   ... know how to work with version control (git) and share data/repositories (GitHub)
-   ... understand how to use R and libraries to tidy and plot data.
-   ... know how to visualize different data types in R.
-   ... know how to visualize data in simple and informative ways using R.

### Skills:
