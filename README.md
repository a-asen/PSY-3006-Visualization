# R visualization

This is a repository for a data visualization course in R. The course has been made as an 'independent study' ([PSY-3006 - Indepdendent study](https://en.uit.no/education/courses/course?p_document_id=805702&semester=H)) for my Masters in Psychology at the UiT - The Arctic University of Norway.

## Content:

In this course, the student will learn how to use R to prepare, transform, and plot data. The course will focus on teaching the student different ways to visualize data sets. The student should learn how to effectively convey messages by choosing appropriate plots and explaining why a certain visualization method is superior to other plots. The student will learn relevant data tidying and transformation needed for the different visualizations. The student should be able to use effective coding strategies -- that are reproducible -- to plot data. The student will have to write a reproducible report using Quarto, which includes the code and the generated output. The course will consist of 5 different exercises that are agreed upon with the supervisor and pertain to various visualization plots. These exercises will be integrated into a final report with reflections and improvements from the student. The student will learn to share their code publicly (e.g., on GitHub). The student will share their coding progress with their supervisors (e.g., on GitHub), where the supervisor can provide feedback and improvements to the code.

## Learning objectives

Having attended the course and completed the exam, the students will obtain the following learning objectives:

### Knowledge and understanding:

-   ... generate and/or find data to be used for plotting.
-   ... know how to work with version control (git) and share data/repositories (GitHub)
-   ... understand how to use R and libraries to tidy and plot data.
-   ... know how to visualize different data types in R.
-   ... know how to visualize data in simple and informative ways using R.

### Skills:

-   ... use git for version control and share data/code (via GitHub)
-   ... use R, various R libraries and Quarto.
-   ... plot data using R and R libraries.
-   ... use different plots to visualize data in R.

### General competence:

-   ... plot data in simple, efficient, and informative ways using R.
-   ... use git for version control and sharing code (GitHub)
-   ... use Quarto to create reports. GitHub repository for data visualization course in R.

# Content of the repository

The repository will have 5 exercise folders containing relevant material for each visualization. Under each folder, I follow conventions for structuring folders (e.g., ProjectTemplate). It will contain a 'src' folder for all R scripts used to create fake data and relevant transformations to create the final data. The data will be stored in the 'data' folder as a '.rdata' file. There may be a folder(s) under each 'data' folder containing data at various stages of creation/transformation. Lastly, a 'report' folder will contain a '.qmd' (Quarto) document, which will the relevant code and text describing the code.
