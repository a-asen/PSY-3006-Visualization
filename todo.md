## Exercise 1: Circle plot - seasonal sleep
-   [x] Fake data:
    -   [x] Daylight hour in Troms√∏ (API call)
    -   [x] Create fake data
    -   [x] Random variation based on a trend
      -   [x] (rnorm can take a vector to change the underlying curve)
    -   [x] Integrate daylight hour & fake data
    -   [x] Structure the data frame (see picture)
        -   [x] Add picture

3rd VIS?
10. Distributions: Yes, but use different dataset, because 
10.1: Reaction times

- distributions
- [ ] Find/make data
- ex-gaussian
- wiener distribution (drift diffusion model)
- Quantile distribution (reaction time, ratcliff)

- Normal &/ bimodal. 
   - Movie rating

- Histogram/violinplot. 
   
   USE: 
continuous:
1 - reaction time (bodyheight / death age) 
2 - bimodal (reaction time over sleep preference)
   rainplot.

discrete: 
   -  Kruschke lidell visualization. 

    - Bivariet distributions.


Distribution of raw AE data. 
AE plots?
