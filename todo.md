- [ ] General introduction
  - [ ] visualization in general
  - [ ] ggplot
    - [ ] Benefits with ggplots
- [ ] Current task/issue
  Circles:
  - [ ] ex1 intro
    - [x] Improved acquire daylight script
    - [ ] Incorporate feedback in a final plot
  - [ ] ex2 intro
    - [ ] Data was prepared ???!!!!
    - [ ] Incorporate feedback in a final plot
    - QUOTE: The polar transformation is useful whenever data lend themselves to circular arrangements. This includes
directional data (vector wind, compass bearings), rotational data (defects on
disk drives), astronomical time (daily, monthly, annual), periodic waveforms
(radio signals), and proportions (the humble pie chart).  GG book (p.215)
