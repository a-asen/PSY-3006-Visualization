    -   [x] Create fake data
    -   [x] Random variation based on a trend
      -   [x] (rnorm can take a vector to change the underlying curve)
    -   [x] Integrate daylight hour & fake data
    -   [x] Structure the data frame (see picture)
        -   [x] Add picture
-   [x] Report: 
    - [x] Motivation?
    -   [x] Visualization
    - [x] normal plot
    -   [x] circle plot
    - [x] aesthetic changes

- [x] Add Feedback

## Exercise 2: Circle plot - sleep times
- [x] Data: mind wandering sleep 
	- [x] circle barplot. 
	- [x] split by noon-midnight & 6am-6pm 
	- [x] Overlay NS & PSD sleep. 
	- [x] Compare against normal plot

## Exam 
- [ ] Include Github link
- [ ] General introduction
  - [ ] visualization in general
  - [ ] ggplot
    - [ ] Benefits with ggplots
- [ ] Current task/issue
  Circles:
  - [ ] ex1 intro
    - [x] Improved acquire daylight script
    - [ ] Incorporate feedback in a final plot
  - [ ] ex2 intro
    - [ ] Data was prepared ???!!!!
    - [ ] Incorporate feedback in a final plot
    - QUOTE: The polar transformation is useful whenever data lend themselves to circular arrangements. This includes
directional data (vector wind, compass bearings), rotational data (defects on
disk drives), astronomical time (daily, monthly, annual), periodic waveforms
(radio signals), and proportions (the humble pie chart).  GG book (p.215)

  Multivariate: 
  - [ ] ex3 intro
    - [ ] Incorporate feedback in a final plot
  - [ ] ex4 intro
    - [ ] Incorporate feedback in a final plot

- End: 
  - [ ] ex1 report
  - [ ] ex2 report
  - [ ] ex3 report
  - [ ] ex4 report
 
  


# Multivariate visualization
## Ex 3 - 2 continous vars
- [ ] Ex3 report
 
  

## Ex 4 - 1 cat 1 continous
- [ ] Ex4 report







3rd VIS?
10. Distributions: Yes, but use different dataset, because 
10.1: Reaction times

- distributions
- [ ] Find/make data
- ex-gaussian
- wiener distribution (drift diffusion model)
- Quantile distribution (reaction time, ratcliff)

- Normal &/ bimodal. 
   - Movie rating

- Histogram/violinplot. 
   
   USE: 
continuous:
1 - reaction time (bodyheight / death age) 
2 - bimodal (reaction time over sleep preference)
   rainplot.

discrete: 
   -  Kruschke lidell visualization. 

    - Bivariet distributions.


Distribution of raw AE data. 
AE plots?
