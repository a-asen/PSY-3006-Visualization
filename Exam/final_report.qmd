# Visualizing

Visualizing data is key to comprehend what data provides us in a simple, and effective way. 

## Grammer of graphics

A principle of visualizing that is incredibly flexible. 

## Introduction and summary: 
- [ ] Ex1 
- [ ] Ex2
- [ ] Ex3 
- [ ] Ex4 


## Ex 1 - circle: seasonal 
- [x] Ex1 report
  - [x] Improved acquire daylight script
  - Feedback:
  circle plot:
    1. Change the scale, not the data itself. 
    2. For circle, do not use confidence interval (SE or quartiles).
    3. Maybe use start sleep to  wake time. (If scaled?) 
    4. Start & stop of sunlight time instead of hour daylight 
      - I.e., visualize time when the sun rise and set
    5. sun rise-set // sleep & wake time. 
      - also on normal plot
    6. use summary 

  
## Ex 2 - circle: sleep time 
- [x] Ex2 report
  - [ ] Could display the clock time as actual clock (lubridate or POSXI)?

- The polar transformation is
useful whenever data lend themselves to circular arrangements. This includes
directional data (vector wind, compass bearings), rotational data (defects on
disk drives), astronomical time (daily, monthly, annual), periodic waveforms
(radio signals), and proportions (the humble pie chart).  GG book (p.215)


# Multivariate visualization
## Ex 3 - 2 continous vars
- [ ] Ex3 report
  - In this report I investigate distribution plots. More specifically joint distributions called "multivariate visualization". I utilize patchwork and ggside to explore how to plot individual distributions around a joint distribution space.

## Ex 4 - 1 cat 1 continous
- [ ] Ex4 report
  - More meaningful splitting of distributions over certain responses
