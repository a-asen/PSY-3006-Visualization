# Visualizing

Visualizing data is key to comprehend what data provides us in a simple, and effective way. 

## Grammer of graphics

A principle of visualizing that is incredibly flexible. 


## Ex 1 - circle: seasonal 
- [x] Ex1 report
  - [x] Improved acquire daylight script
  feedback:
  circle plot:
1. change the scale, not the data itself. 
2. for circle, dont use confidence interval (SE or quartiles).
3. Maybe use start sleep to  wake time. (If scaled?) 
4. start & stop of sunlight time (when does sun rise, and when does it reduce)?
5. sun rise-set // sleep & wake time. 
  - also on normal plot
6. use summary 
 EX: 7.  Use circle for seasonal 


  
## Ex 2 - circle: sleep time 
- [x] Ex2 report
  - [ ] Could display the clock time as actual clock (lubridate or POSXI)?

- The polar transformation is
useful whenever data lend themselves to circular arrangements. This includes
directional data (vector wind, compass bearings), rotational data (defects on
disk drives), astronomical time (daily, monthly, annual), periodic waveforms
(radio signals), and proportions (the humble pie chart).  GG book (p.215)


# Multivariate visualization
## Ex 3 - 2 continous vars
- [ ] Ex3 report

## Ex 4 - 1 cat 1 continous
- [ ] Ex4 report

## Final reflections
