# Visualizing

Visualizing data is key to comprehend what data provides us in a simple, and effective way. 

## Grammer of graphics

A principle of visualizing that is incredibly flexible. 


## Ex 1 - circle: seasonal 
- [x] Ex1 report
  - [x] Improved acquire daylight script
  feedback:
  circle plot:
1. change the scale, not the data itself. 
2. for circle, dont use confidence interval (SE or quartiles).
3. Maybe use start sleep to  wake time. (If scaled?) 
4. start & stop of sunlight time (when does sun rise, and when does it reduce)?
5. sun rise-set // sleep & wake time. 
  - also on normal plot
6. use summary 
 EX: 7.  Use circle for seasonal 


  
## Ex 2 - circle: sleep time 
- [x] Ex2 report
  - [ ] Could display the clock time as actual clock (lubridate or POSXI)?

## Ex 3 - ? 
- [ ] Ex3 report

3rd VIS?
10. Distributions: Yes, but use different dataset, because 
10.1: Reaction times

USE: 
continuous:
1 - reaction time (bodyheight / death age) 
2 - bimodal (reaction time over sleep preference)
   rainplot.

discrete: 
   -  Kruschke lidell visualization. 
3 - univariate visualization?

3rd 3d visualization. 
    - Bivariet distributions.


## Ex 4 
- [ ] Ex4 report

## Ex 5 
- [ ] Ex5 report

## Final reflections
