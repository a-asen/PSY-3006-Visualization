# Visualizing

Visualizing data is key to comprehend what data provides us in a simple, and effective way. 

## Grammer of graphics

A principle of visualizing that is incredibly flexible. 

## Exercises 


bla bla bla bout the exercises

## Circle visualization
For the two first exercises (1, 2), I focus on circular visualization. In the first exercise I start by visualizing sleep data throughout a year. The data for this exercise has been generate (see "src" scripts). Then I processed to visualizing sleep data from an experiment. Where I try to indicate the difference between two sleep conditions - one sleep deprived and one with normal sleep.

## Multivariate visualization
For the two latter exercises (3, 4), I focus on multivariate visualization. Especially in relation to the joint distribution of two continuous variables of a categorical and a continuous variable.

### Ex3: Continuous-continuous
  - In this report I investigate distribution plots. More specifically joint distributions called "multivariate visualization". I utilize patchwork and ggside to explore how to plot individual distributions around a joint distribution space.

### Ex4: Categorical-continuous
  - More meaningful splitting of distributions over certain responses
